  I'm trying to show the weather by calling an external api in this project  
  If you want to run this application on your own computer.</p>
  
  <p class="text-muted">
   Go to the <a href="https://openweathermap.org/api">Open Weather Map</a> , register and get your own api key then you can call the api with your own key.
